# MIM (Minimal Identity Mozaic)

MIM is a Hash Visualization format utilising 4x4 colour matrixes. This provides a quick and easy method to compare fingerprints, e.g. SSH keys, x509 certs etc.

*Note. MIM may not be appropriate when ANSI colours have been customised, either via the vendor or user on different applications.*
